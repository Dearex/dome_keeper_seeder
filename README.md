**This is a python project to generate or save seeds for Dome Keeper made by https://bippinbits.com/**

Currently there are two independent files, one to just save every generated seed, another one to automatically generate seeds while afking. Produces about four seeds a minute :)

Settings/Things to do:

For both: 
- Change the mode you are currently generating for sorting
- Change the Paths according to your file System

For the seed_copy.py:
- Doesn't save the currently stored file

For the auto Generator:
- You might also change Keybindings or the Speed modifier



Use at own risk, suggestions are welcome!
