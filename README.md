**This is a python project to generate or save seeds for Dome Keeper made by https://bippinbits.com/**

Currently there are two independent files, one to just save every generated seed, another one to automatically generate seeds while afking. Produces about four seeds a minute :)

Settings/Things to do:

For both: 
- Change the mode you are currently generating for sorting
- Change the Paths according to your file System

For the seed_copy.py:
- Doesn't save the currently stored file

For the Auto Generator:
- You might also change Keybindings or the Speed modifier
- On Windows you can use RUN_IN_BACKGROUND to generate the seeds without the potential to interrupt other windows and the ability to use your pc in the meantime. You can even minimize the window.



Modules to install:
pyautogui
pywin32

Use at own risk, suggestions are welcome!
